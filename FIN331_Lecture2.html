<h2>Interest rate risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>A mismatch between the maturity of interest rate sensitive assets and the maturity of interest rate sensitive liabilities leads to interest rate risk
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;Banks funding 30-year fixed interest rate home loans with 1-month term deposits</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Banks face <strong>reinvestment risk</strong> if the maturity of assets is shorter than the maturity of liabilities</li>
<li>Banks face <strong>refinancing risk</strong> if the maturity of liabilities is shorter than the maturity of assets</li>
<li>Monetary policy and expectations surrounding changes in central bank interest rates are a key driver of market interest rates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Refresher on bond pricing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully, you recall the bond pricing equations:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
P &amp;= \frac{C}{(1+y)} + \frac{C}{(1+y)^2} + \frac{C}{(1+y)^3} + ... + \frac{F + C}{(1+y)^N} \\
P &amp;= \frac{C}{y} [1-(1+y)^{-N}] + \frac{F}{(1+y)^N}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Yield to maturity (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>)
<ul>
<li>There is a negative relation between interest rate changes and price changes on financial securities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time remaining to maturity (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>)
<ul>
<li>The shorter the time to maturity the closer the price is to the face value of the security</li>
